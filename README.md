Bruteforcing Script 
by burchthehacker

Created a bruteforcing script to assist with bruteforcing CTFs.
This is the basic script that I will develop.

How to use:

Go to burp suite and look at you post request in repeater.
Right click on the request and "Change request method".
This will change the POST request to GET.
Then change the data below where I have commented # change.
